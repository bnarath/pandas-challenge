# Heroes of Pymoli
In this project, we have to analyze the data of fantasy game "Heroes of Pymoli". The game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience.

 # PyCitySchools
 In this project, we need to help making strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. We have to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. 
 <div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Pycity_photo1.png"></div>

# Tasks
We are given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. We need <strong>to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.</strong>

Your final report should include each of the following:

- District Summary: Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
  - Total Schools
  - Total Students
  - Total Budget
  - Average Math Score
  - Average Reading Score
  - % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  - % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  - % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)
- School Summary: Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  - School Name
  - School Type
  - Total Students
  - Total School Budget
  - Per Student Budget
  - Average Math Score
  - Average Reading Score
  - % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  - % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  - % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)
- Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing): Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:
  - School Name
  - School Type
  - Total Students
  - Total School Budget
  - Per Student Budget
  - Average Math Score
  - Average Reading Score
  - % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  - % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  - % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)
- Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing): Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include all of the same metrics as above.
- Math Scores by Grade: Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
- Reading Scores by Grade: Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
- Scores by School Spending: Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
  - Average Math Score
  - Average Reading Score
  - % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  - % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  - % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)
- Scores by School Size: Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).
- Scores by School Type: Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
